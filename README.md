# Education30
This repository was created during the 2024 Women Who Code Days of Code Challenge. I chose to work on my web development skills, beginning with the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com) challenge from Wes Bos. Rather than posting his solutions (which you can get [here](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)), in this repository I have adapted the challenges to create resources for educators. Take a look at each project to read about what I learned and challenges I faced.
